# Supplementary Materials for Neural Network Orchestration
We provide codes and the supplementary materials for the paper "Seek Common While Shelving Differences: Orchestrating Deep Neural Networks for Edge Service Provisioning" submitted to IEEE JSAC-Series-Machine Learning in Communications and Networks.

## Online Appendix
Please find the online appendix (online_appendix.pdf) in the above repository. It contains pseudocodes and proofs referred in the manuscript. 

## Code/Environment of Edge Computing Systems 
Since the paper is in the peer-review process, we only provide part of the code, the environment of edge computing systems (EdgeEnv.py). Full code will be released after the paper is accepted.
