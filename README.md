# Neural Network Orchestration
We provide codes and the supplementary materials for the paper "Seek Common While Shelving Difference: Neural Network Orchestration for Service Provision in Edge Computing Systems" submitted to JSAC-Series- Machine Learning in Communications and Networks.

# Supplementary Materials/Online Appendix
Please find supplementary materials for the paper (supp_file.pdf) in the above repository. It contains pseudocodes and proofs referred in the manuscript. 

# Code/Environment of Edge Computing Systems 
Since the paper is in the peer-review process, we only provide part of the code, the environment of edge computing systems. Full code will be released after the paper is accepted.
