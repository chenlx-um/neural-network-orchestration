# Supplementary Materials for Neural Network Orchestration
We provide codes and the supplementary materials for the paper "Seek Common While Shelving Difference: Neural Network Orchestration for Service Provision in Edge Computing Systems" submitted to IEEE JSAC-Series-Machine Learning in Communications and Networks.

## Online Appendix
Please find the online appendix (online_appendix.pdf) in the above repository. It contains pseudocodes and proofs referred in the manuscript. 

## Code/Environment of Edge Computing Systems 
Since the paper is in the peer-review process, we only provide part of the code, the environment of edge computing systems. Full code will be released after the paper is accepted.
